Since its inception in 2005, the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) has become the nation’s largest and most spectacular New Year’s Eve celebration. 

Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), this iconic event allows everyone to enjoy the unique cityscape and vibrant atmosphere as we usher in the New Year.
