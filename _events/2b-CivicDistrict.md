Take a peek into the special exhibition Living with Ink: The Collection of Dr Tan Tsze Chor then customise your own special Chinese art canvas bag inspired by the exhibition. Round off 2019 at the museum by catching the New Year’s Eve fireworks from the ACM Green. Families and kids, young and old, all are welcome!
