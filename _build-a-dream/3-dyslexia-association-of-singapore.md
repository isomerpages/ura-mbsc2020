## Xuan Ying, 11 years old
**About Xuan Ying**<br>
Xuan Ying is passionate about art, having developed an interest in drawing and painting at the age of five. She enjoys the creative process of bringing an idea to life on canvas, deriving great satisfaction upon completion of each artwork. Yet, she faces certain challenges in learning, being unable to read and spell most words. In the past, this resulted in her being reluctant to even attempt tasks, since she found the difficulties insurmountable. 
<br>
<br>
Xuan Ying joined the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) in 2015, which provided guidance for her individual needs, and helped her lay a foundation in literacy. Her reading and spelling abilities have since soared, providing a welcome boost to her self-esteem. Nowadays, it is common to see her with a book in hand, enjoying a good read.

# About Dyslexia Association of Singapore 
  
Children suffering from dyslexia are often misunderstood, mislabelled and deprived of the proper attention and support. DAS aims to provide the expertise to assess and help dyslexic students keep up with their peers in school. In Singapore, about 23,000 children in the age range of 6 to 16 require specialist intervention. 
<br>
<br>
Donors help reduce DAS' annual operating deficits and help fund dyslexic children who need financial assistance in overcoming their learning differences. Each donation received will go towards the most pressing need. With funding from donors, we will definitely be able to maximise our resources to reach out extensively to more dyslexic students.
