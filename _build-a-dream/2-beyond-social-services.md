## Nursyahran, 6 years old
**About Nursyahran**<br>
The second youngest of five siblings, Nursyahran is excited to start primary school next year, and wants to be a policeman when he grows up to help people and keep Singapore safe. For seven years now, Nursyahran’s family has been with Beyond Social Services. Despite numerous challenges over the years, Nursyahran’s parents have provided for their family as best they can. Responsive to their children’s educational needs, they work closely with Beyond Social Services to get support whenever there are learning opportunities, for both their children and themselves. Currently, Nursyahran is with Healthy Start Children Development Centre, where children like him are provided with the care and education they need through personalised education plans.

# About Beyond Social Services
  
Beyond Social Services serves disadvantaged young people and their families to move them beyond their problems. We want to develop young people who respect the law, value education and seek to become responsible persons.
<br>
<br>
Keeping young lives on track is about building a community where they can grow, contribute and believe that they are a part of. Beyond works to build inclusive communities where young people, local neighbourhoods, and wider society, can come together to share their gifts and cooperate on resolving their issues.
<br>
<br>
We value inter-organisational collaboration and will steadily expand by building networks of individuals and organisations that contribute towards our vision. We believe that the children and youth whom we serve always benefit when more members of the community take an active interest in their well-being.
