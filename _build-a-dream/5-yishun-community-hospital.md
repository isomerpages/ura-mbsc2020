**About Yan and Kassie, Volunteer Artists**
<br>
Yishun Community Hospital, a medical institution under Yishun Health, is one of Singapore's largest community hospitals that provides rehabilitation services. These services focus on helping patients recover and regain their health and daily functions through therapy and education.
<br>
<br>
At Yishun Health, Yan, Kassie, and their fellow dedicated volunteers play an active role in supporting the elderly patients, providing a listening ear, as well as bonding with them through activities such as Japanese pastel art, gardening, and reading. Through simple acts of kindness, Yan and Kassie believe that everyone can play a bigger role in helping our seniors and building a more gracious, caring society. 
<br>
<br>
From the Pioneer to Merdeka Generations, our seniors have selflessly given themselves to building and growing our nation. Little gestures can make a big difference. Give back to the community (and to our seniors) by volunteering your time today!

# About Yishun Community Hospital 
Opened in 2016, Yishun Community Hospital is one of Singapore's largest community hospitals to provide rehabilitation services. Situated next to acute-care Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, the two hospitals are connected by sky link bridges and bring about an integrated care experience for patients, through connected network of healthcare teams, information flow and treatment plans. 
<br>
<br>
The 428-bed community hospital provides intermediate care for recuperating patients who do not require the intensive services of an acute-care hospital. Yishun Community Hospital provides a range of services from rehabilitation and sub-acute care to geriatric, dementia and palliative care services, to help support the growing ageing population in Singapore.
