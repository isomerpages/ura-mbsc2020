      <font color="orangered"><b>About Build a Dream</b></font>
      <br> Join us in making the dream of an inclusive society come true. Now in its second year, the Build a Dream campaign started as a joint initiative by Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) and the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) to support those in need. This festive season, we’re bringing cheer to four organisations. From fostering a caring community to providing financial aid, learn how you can contribute to their hopes and dreams for Singapore!
      <br>
      <br>From 26 to 31 December 2019, beautiful artworks by beneficiaries from these organisations will light up Marina Bay’s iconic landmarks, transforming the Fullerton Hotel Singapore, the Merlion and ArtScience Museum into a delightful bay full of hopes and dreams.
Head down to Marina Bay for all this and more, as we welcome the New Year!
